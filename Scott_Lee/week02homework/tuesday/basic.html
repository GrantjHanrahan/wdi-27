                On December 28 of 1903, Neumann János Lajos, (a name equivlant in English to John Louis), was born in Budapest in the Austro-Hungarian empire.</br></br>He was the eldest of three brothers; his two younger siblings were Michael (b. 1907) and Nicholas (b. 1911).</br></br>John's father, Neumann Miksa, was a lawyer by education but banker by trade. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann).</br></br>
                He was born a non-observant Jewish family, and was an agnostic throughout his entire life. However, on his deathbed, he seemed to admit that Pascal had a point and converted to Catholicism.

                Von Neumann's academic life began early. He had a photographic memory, and by the age of 8, was fluent in English, French, German, Italian, and Ancient Greek.</br></br>
                At age 15, von Neumann studied under Gábor Szegő. Szegő was himself an accomplished mathematician, whose contributions in analysis had a significant impact in applied mathematics, theoretical physics and statistics. Szegő, astounded by von Neumann's genius, was brought to tears on their first day.</br></br>

                Despite von Neumann's influence in the mathematics and the sciences, he was not the most pleasant person to be associated with outside an academic setting.</br></br>
                He enjoyed being in loud environments, and while living on campus, disturbed his neighbours playing music continuously. He criticized his wife for preparing a study area that was too quiet, and began to work in the living room with the tv playing instead.</br></br>
                His poor driving ability resulted in many arrests and accidents. Nevertheless, he enjoyed driving while simultaneously reading a book.
