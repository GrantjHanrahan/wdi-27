        Throughout this career, there was a common epistemological theme underlying von Neumann's works. As such, a significant portion of his time in mathematics was spent reformalizing axiomatic mathematics, namely introducing techniques to resolve earlier inconsistencies.</br></br>
        Once a strong axiomatic foundation had been built, his next consideration was whether such a system would be capable of providing definitive answers on questions posed to it.</br></br>
        Kurt GÃ¶del provided a proof, now known as the first incompleteness theorem, which stated this was not the case.</br></br>
        Building upon previous work, von Neumann also axiomatized quantum mechanics. By treating position or momentum as a linear operator, von Neumann showed that the evolution of a quantum system over time was isomorphically similar to a point in Hilbert space (generalization of 2-D vector space to n-dimensions).

        In the late 1930s, von Neumann became recognized as the leading expert in the quantitative description of explosive phenomena. As a result, von Neumann was involved in the design of nuclear weapons.</br></br>
        In his model of an atomic bomb, von Neuamnn conceptualized he idea of explosive lensing, which internally reflected neutrons from U-238. This resulted in an implosion which brought the plutonium to critical mass for detonation.</br></br>
        Von Neumann was part of the committee responsible for choosing a detonation site for this atomic bomb. Many factors were taken into account, such as blast radius, death tolls, optimum shockwave propagation, and lasting atmospheric radiation.</br></br>
        His first choice was Kyoto. This decision was overruled, and the Fat Man atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki instead.
