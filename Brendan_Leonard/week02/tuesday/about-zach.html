                    <p>Zach grew up in Chicago to a lamaze instructor mother and a professional story telling father. An unconventional childhood but one that fueled his creative passions and artistic drive from an early age.</p>
                    <p>As a child he loved nothing more than visiting art museums and was a keen drawer and sculptor. That continued after high school when he attended Hunter College, part of the City University of New York and one of America's finest art schools.</p>
                    <p>Graduating in 2000 he bluffed his way into a web design job with no technical skills whatsoever. He became obsessed with computer animation and taught himself Flash and ActionScript from books.</p>
                    <p>He decided to go all-in on programming and attended post graduate studies at Parsons School of Design. He stayed on and taught at Parsons for 10 years; eventually becoming a professor.</p>
                    <p>The non-teaching parts of the job got him down and so he quit and started his own school called the <a href="http://sfpc.io">School for Poetic Computation</a>.</p>
                    <p>One of Zach's most import contributions to computer science has been <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>, a tool for artists. It's an open source C++ toolkit that is used to create a framework of easy-to-use software tools for artists to use.</p>
                    <p>Zach is also the driving force behind the inspirational <a href="http://eyewriter.org/">EyeWriter</a>. A low-cost system that has enabled a famous LA gravity artist, Tempt1, who is now completely physically paralyzed due to a form of motor neurone disease, to create art by simply moving his eyes.</p>
                    <p>In addition to all of the above he also runs a creative studio with his wife, <a href="http://www.molmolk.com/">Molmol Kuo</a>, an accomplished commercial artist. His other big passion is using his coding skills to create unbelievable electronic music. He performed at music festivals in Europe for many years.</p>
