      <h1>“Amazing Grace”</h1>
      <h2>Grace Hopper - pioneering computer programmer</h2>
      <p>United States Navy Admiral Grace Hopper (1906–1992) was one of the first programmers in the history of computers. Her belief that programming languages should be as easily understood as English was highly influential on the development of one of the first programming languages called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" id="cobol">COBOL</a>. It is largely due to Grace Hopper’s influence that programmers use <strong>“if/thens”</strong> instead of 1s and 0s today!</p>

             <h3>1931 - Early Life</h3>
             <p>Grace Hopper studied math and physics at Vassar College. After graduating from Vassar in 1928, she proceeded to Yale University, where, in 1930 (age 25), she received a master's degree in mathematics.<br><br>Starting in 1931, Hopper began teaching at Vassar while also continuing to study at Yale, where she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1934 (age 28).</p>

             <h3>1943-World War II</h3>
             <p>Grace Hopper took a leave of absence from teaching at Vassar to enlist in the US Navy Reserve in 1943, becoming a part of WAVES. She had to obtain an exemption in order to enlist since she weighed in at 7 kg below the required weight.<br><br>Despite what could have been a disadvantage, she graduated first in her class and was assigned the rank of lieutenant, junior grade. She was immediately assigned to the programming staff for the new Mark I computer (an electro-mechanical computer weighing over 4500 kg) at Harvard University.</p>

             <h3>Born Programmer</h3>
             <p>Often people assume that Grace M. Hopper must have loved computers to decide to work with them. The truth is she didn't know what they were when the Navy assigned her to work on the Harvard Mark I. Grace learned to program when she was 37 years old!</p>

             <h3>Computer Bugs</h3>
             <p>Though Grace is often credited with coining the term "computer bug" the phrase "bug in the machine" was already in use. Grace loved to tell the story about how they “debugged” the Mark II computer by removing the living moth, bringing the obscure engineering term into popular use in computer science.</p>

             <h3>“A compiler”</h3>
             <p>In the 1950s, Grace started working for a company called Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation as the senior mathematician on the team developing a new computer. It was at this position that she created what is called the “A compiler.” <br><br>In computer programming, a compiler is a program that transforms source code written from one computer language into another, usually less complex, language.</p>

             <h3>1954</h3>
             <p>In computer programming, a compiler is a program that transforms source code written from one computer language into another, usually less complex, language. <br><br>While compilers are indispensable to programmers today, they were revolutionary at a time when computers where mainly used, as their name implies, for performing computations: “Nobody believed that,” she said. “I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.” <br><br>Eventually her work there was recognized and she was named the company’s first director of automatic programming.</p>

             <h3>1959</h3>
             <p>Grace is often credited with developing the programming language COBOL. However, this is incorrect. Grace wrote a program called FLOW-MATIC, which the team who built COBOL based thier project on. She is referred to as the "Grandmother of COBOL" as opposed to "The Mother of COBOL" for this reason.<br><br> She developed a validation software for COBOL to make sure the language could perform its function. COBOL, which stands for “COmmon Business-Oriented Language”, is still used in order-processing business software today.</p>

             <h3>COBOL</h3>
             <p>Grace continued to work on COBOL as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group, and was promoted to captain in 1973. Throughout the seventies, she pioneered work in designing and implementing technology standards for the US Navy. <br><br>The tests and standards she developed were later adopted by the National Bureau of Standards (today called the National Institute of Standards and Technology), and helped to shape the future of programming.</p>

           <h3>1986</h3>
           <p>Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve in 1966, but her pioneering computer work meant that she was recalled to active duty—at the age of 60—to tackle standardising communication between different computer languages. She would remain with the Navy for 19 years. When she retired in 1986, at age 79, she was a rear admiral as well as the oldest serving officer in the service.</p>

           <h3>More...</h3>
           <p>In addition to her programming accomplishments, Hopper's legacy includes encouraging young people to learn how to program. The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women In Computing Conference is a technical conference that encourages women to become part of the world of computing, while the Association for Computing Machinery offers a Grace Murray Hopper Award.</p>
