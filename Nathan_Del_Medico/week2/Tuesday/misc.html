        Larry's inspiration was mostly his family, amongst which he mentions his grandmother who earned her Ph.D. in comparative literature at age 77. He also aknowledges 19th century writer George Macdonald as a role model throughout his entire life.

        Larry stated that the creation of Perl has been directly inspired by bumping into a problem that the tools available couldn't solve in the wanted parameters.

        "Right from the start, Perl was designed for change. This involves certain tradeoffs, some of which appear to be suboptimal to people who don't think the way I think. For instance, I wanted to be able to add new keywords to Perl without breaking old programs, so I put them into a separate namespace from variable names. This meant either variable names or keywords had to be marked somehow as special. I chose to mark variables, since it also made it easy to interpolate variables into strings, and since there's a history of marking variables in computer languages such as BASIC."</i> - Larry Wall
